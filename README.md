# Free energy surface reconstruction
The objective of this library is to generate free energy surface from temperature accelerated methods like Temperatue Acclerated Molecular Dynamics (TAMD/d-AFED), Unified Free Energy Dynamics (UFED), Temperature Accelerated Sliced Sampling (TASS) and Solute Tempered Adibatic Free energy dynamics.
